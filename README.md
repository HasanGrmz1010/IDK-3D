# Missile Control 3D
The mobile arcade game that I am currently working on. Player controls a missile that constantly moving forward. By touching; missile turns 45 degree upward, by releasing; missile turns 45 degree downward. Player tries to awoid hammers, blades, moving walls etc. and reach the end of the level safely. Once reached, player should tap in series to fill the Tap-O-Meter, which grants 100 extra coin. If player fails to fill the Tap-O-Meter missile explodes.
